# Seth Parcell's First CS193 Homework

## List of my Favorite things about CS193 :D

- It seems like an easy and relaxing class to learn a little bit of supplemental info to help in CS.
- TAs are super cool(pls give me an A)
- I am a Linux user(OpenSUSE) so I get to nerd out really hard since I already know a decent bit.
- I had to miss one of my club callouts on Tuesday because the class is at 6:30(No sarcasm hereðŸ™ƒ)
